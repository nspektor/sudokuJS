# Sudokill
### Implementation by Team Marshmallow: Nellie Spektor and Nehemiah Dureus
### Game Created by Dennis Shasha: [description](https://cs.nyu.edu/courses/fall20/CSCI-GA.2965-001/sudokill)

To Do
- Timer to record time elapsed for each player
- Color logic for different players' moves 
- Make sure the game works as a pop-up in drecco
- Highlight most recent move
- Board Size Variable
- Disallow editing already placed numbers
- stop allowing edits after a player loses
- grey out and disable the parts of the board that aren't allowed by the row/col rule.
- Make it so the game checks logic against the whole board (not just the original board)
